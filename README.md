# LogosTeach Jupyter Public Repo

### MIT License with modifications

These notebooks are licensed under MIT, but must not be resold as proprietary products without explicit permission from logosteach.com

## Introduction 

LogosTeach is an educational platform dedicated to the belief that students who trust in Christ Jesus can learn from a place of true rest-through worship, dedication, and the simple joy of glorifying God… and enjoying Him forever.

## Statement of Faith 

LogosTeach.com is reformed in its theology-yet we reach out to every believer, across denominations, who trust Christ alone for salvation: that they've been accepted into God's family, justified now, sanctified day by day, and will, without fail, be glorified. Our statement of faith draws directly from the Westminster Confession of Faith, and acknowledges differences in views on baptism as non-essential.

## Jupyter Notebooks and Their Purpose 

These Jupyter notebooks blend live code, visuals, and notes-all in one spot-so lessons stay hands-on and interactive. They’re also open to the public: anyone chasing Python skills, from scratch or upgrade, can dive right in.

## Homeschool and Christian Schools 

LogosTeach welcomes both. Homeschool families get flexible, self-paced tools-perfect for parents steering the ship. Christian school teachers can grab these notebooks for classrooms, adding coding depth without rewriting plans. Feel free to adapt, but please-respect the MIT license we’ve tucked in up top, even the tweaks. Happy teaching!
