## Introduction 

LogosTeach is an educational platform dedicated to the belief that students who trust in Christ Jesus can learn from a place of true rest-through worship, dedication, and the simple joy of glorifying Godâ€¦ and enjoying Him forever.

## Statement of Faith 

LogosTeach.com is reformed in its theology-yet we reach out to every believer, across denominations, who trust Christ alone for salvation: that they've been accepted into God's family, justified now, sanctified day by day, and will, without fail, be glorified. Our statement of faith draws directly from the Westminster Confession of Faith, and acknowledges differences in views on baptism as non-essential.
